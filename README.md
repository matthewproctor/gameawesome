## Welcome to Game Awesome

This is a simple JavaScript game using FontAwesome instead of traditional graphics sprites.  Check out the font at [FontAwsesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

Why did I build this? We were joking at the office about making a game using FontAwesome's new collection of sci-fi font characters, got bored one night at home, so created this.

The game is available at [https://matthewproctor.github.io/gameawesome/](https://matthewproctor.github.io/gameawesome/)
